SDApp Backend 


Core-Files of the SDApp
Complete rewrite of the old, bad Spiritdesktop-Application. It will
download a timetable of a class of the 'FH-Schmalkalden' (Computer
Science section) via cURL and parse the JSON-File (JSONcpp).
Data is stored as 3-dimensional array of events.

Requires:
libcURL
JSON-cpp


Spirit itself can be found at:
http://spirit.fh-schmalkalden.de
https://github.com/spirit-fhs


Spiritdesktop and SDApp are not(!) "officialy" supported by the University
of Applied Science Schmalkalden or PADS-LAB and thus.
